##‎1. Fundamental DevOps Concepts
DevOps is a practice whose aim is to bring together developers (who write code) and operations teams to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.
‎
‎Core principles of DevOps 
Automation – Automate tasks like testing, building, and deployment in DevOps to speed up software releases and delivery.
Collaboration – DevOps teams work closely together, share responsibilities, and communicate openly to improve working efficiency.
Continuous Improvement – Encourage regular feedback loops from the team and customer.

##2. DevOps Lifecycle
- Planning – Requirements are defined, goals are set, and tasks are prioritized for what software or application needs to be built.
- Development – Write the code for the application or system features.
- ‎Building – Compile the code and prepare it for use in a usable format, then run automated builds.
- ‎Testing– Testing the code written by a developer
- ‎Release– Prepare the tested code for deployment in a live environment.
- ‎Deployment – Launch the code to production, allowing users to utilize it.
- ‎Operation – Keep the system running smoothly, manage infrastructure, and ensure system availability.
- ‎Monitoring– Track performance and user feedback to detect issues and improve future updates.
